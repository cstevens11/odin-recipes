    <h2>Once you eat this, you'll think less of all other vegan cheeses.</h2>
      <p> As long as you have a blender, this is going to be one of your new 
         favorite things to make. Replace real cheese in a nacho platter with this 
         and all your vegan friends will fall madly in love with you while your non-vegan 
         friends contemplate how non-cheese ingredients can work so well as a replacement.

      <p>Large group of people coming over? Just double the amount of the ingredients and make 
          an even bigger batch!
      </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>1 cup</strong> potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> large carrot, peeled and chopped</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> water from boiling carrots (save more in case 
          consistency is too thick)</li>
          <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> olive oil</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> salt + more if needed</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 tbsp</strong> lemon juice</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> nutritional yeast</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 tsp</strong> onion powder</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> garlic powder</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> paprika</li>
          <li>pinch of cayenne</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Boil the carrots and the potatoes in separate pots until they 
              are soft enough to easily poke through with a fork. Be sure to
              save all the water from the carrot pot (the potato water will 
              not be needed).</li>
          <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, 2 tbsp olive oil, and 1/4 cup carrot
              water to the blender. Blend together until very smooth.</li>
          <li>Add remaining ingredients and blend until cheese is very smooth.</li>
          <li>Dip a chip or spoon into blender and pull up to check cheese consistency. 
              If it does not pour like real nacho cheese add more of the reserved carrot 
              water until desired consistency is reached.</li>
          <li>Taste cheese and adjust to perfection with salt, paprika, cayenne, etc. 
              (I usually end up tossing in extra garlic/onion powder, cayenne and paprika 
            until the perfect level of spicyness is achieved.</li>
          <li>Pour that blender of nacho gold onto whatever your heart desires and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
