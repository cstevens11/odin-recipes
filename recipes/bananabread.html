    <h2>Have bananas that are a bit too old to eat? Harvest their true worth.</h2>
      <p>
          Spend <strong>15 minutes on prep</strong> right now, go vibe 
          for an hour, and then follow your nose to the fruits <em>(or
          fruit bread)</em> of your labor. This easy recipe is perfect 
          for a late night, a date night, or literally any other time 
          of the day.
      </p>
      <p> This banana bread is easy and simple; it should take about 
          <strong>15 minutes</strong> to mix everything together and another
          <strong>50/60 minutes</strong> to bake. The extra time to let the 
          bread cool is entirely up to you and your own burn tolerance.
      </p>
